## Project Description
*The Little Scrapbook Factory* was created to be used as a blog site. Its designed as most of the scrapbooking blogs that focus on a vintage look with a bit of a modern touch to it.
The sites provides a *Homepage*, a *Blog* page with the links to individual *Posts*, a *Contact* page and *About me* page. The sites gives the possibility to read and sort the posts within different categories. In addition, the reader can comment on the content and take contact with the owner of the blogsite.
